# Understanding Budgets in PERA FIN CORE

## What is a Budget?

A budget is a plan that helps you manage your money by setting limits on how much you can spend in different categories (like groceries, entertainment, or transportation) over a specific time period.

## How Budgets Work in PERA FIN CORE

### 1. Creating a Budget

Creating a budget in PERA FIN CORE is simple:

1. **Choose a category** - Select what you want to budget for (e.g., "Groceries", "Entertainment")
2. **Set an amount** - Decide how much money you want to allocate
3. **Pick a time period** - Choose monthly, quarterly, or yearly
4. **Set start and end dates** - Define when your budget begins and ends
